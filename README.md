# AC2
My solutions to AC2 of UA's Computer and Telematics Engineering course.

To use all the tools, you need to install pic32mx tools package (the one I provide is the 32-bit version).
Just copy it to your ```/opt/``` folder and add the following to ur ```.bashrc``` file:
```
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/pic32mx/bin/"
```
These tools were provided by UA, I do not own them.
